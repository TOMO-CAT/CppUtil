# Blade Project Examples

Your can browse the example code and BUILD files, and can try to build it with `blade.sh`:

```bash
blade.sh build foo...
```

NOTE: All `BUILD` files and `BLADE_ROOT` has a `.EXAMPLE` suffix because we don't want to confuse
your workspace if you put the blade source code into your workspace.
